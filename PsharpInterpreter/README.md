# P# version 0.4


P# is a programming language designed to get the best of both worlds between the simple syntax of python and the speed and optimizing compiler of C#
P# has an interpreter like python in case you want to use it for quick scripting, and can compile to CLR bytecode. I might possibly make its own compiler but if I do it will be called Pflat

Note that the two previous lines are assuming that the language is actually at its 1.0 release or higher 

# Syntax

P# has syntax like python with some C family mixed in, here are some examples:

To declare a variable named x you can use "var x;"
You can also assign it in-line like this: "var x = 5;"
To delcare a constant variable you can use "let x = 5;"
That is inferring the type, if you like you can also use static typing like: "var int x = 5;" or "let int x = 5;"
